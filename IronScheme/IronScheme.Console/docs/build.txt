Build
=====

This file is for information regarding rebuilding the IronScheme bootfile.

A. Rebuild from command line in Windows

- Run 'Ironscheme.Console ironscheme-buildscript.ss'.
- The generated file will be compiled to a binary (dll) the next time IronScheme is run.

B. Rebuild from command line for Mono

- Run 'mono Ironscheme.Console.exe ironscheme-buildscript.ss'.
- The generated file will be compiled to a binary (dll) the next time IronScheme is run.

C. Rebuild from the REPL

- Run '(ironscheme-build)'.
- Restart IronScheme.

Optionally you can then run (compile-system-libraries) from the REPL or as described in install.txt to recompile commonly used libraries.

You can modify which libraries gets compiled by editing the system-libraries.ss file.

Notes:

- only files in the build and psyntax directory are compiled into the bootfile.
- the above mentioned makes up mostly of R6RS and a few extra IronScheme-specific procedures.
- take care when making changes to the build system as this can break your IronScheme installation.
