Interop
=======

From Scheme to .NET:

There are 2 options:

1. Create a .NET method and add the [Builtin] attribute to it. The procedure is now available via (symbol-value name).
   This approach is handy when extending the 'base' libraries.
   Note: the return type must be of type object, else tail calls will fail. Object parameters also preferred.
   
2. Use the (ironscheme clr) library.
   There are various syntactic constructs that emits .NET method calls, property get/set, etc directly.
   Note: Parameters will be automatically casted to the target type.
   
From .NET to Scheme:

1. Eval a string and get a returned object. TODO: make an easy interface for this.

2. Use a scheme procedure passed as an argument to a .NET method. 
   Scheme procedures are of type Callable, and capture their environment.
