* Purely Functional Data Structures in Scheme     -*- org -*-

** About
pfds is a set of purely functional data structures written in R6RS
Scheme. It has been tested with Racket, Guile 2, Vicare Scheme and
IronScheme. Right now it contains
- queues
- deques
- bbtrees
- sets
- dlists
- priority search queues (psqs)
- finger trees
- sequences
- heaps
- hamts

with more to come, time permitting.

** Installation
Just clone it somewhere on your $GUILE_LOAD_PATH and you're
done. Alternatively, a pkg-list.scm file is provided for use with the
dorodango package manager.If you want to run the tests file, you will
need trc-testing from the [[http://gitorious.org/wak][wak project]].

** Documentation
Documentation is provided at the top of the respective files. The
queues and deques are based on the paper [[http://www.eecs.usma.edu/webs/people/okasaki/pubs.html#jfp95]["Simple and Efficient Purely
Functional Queues and Deques"]] by Chris Okasaki. The bbtrees and sets
are based on the paper [[http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/adams/BB/92-10.ps]["Implementing Sets Efficiently in a Functional
Language"]] by Stephen Adams.

Dlists are a well known trick in the functional programming community,
going back to at least [[http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/lists.pdf][“A Novel Representation of Lists and its
application to the Function "Reverse"”]] by John Hughes in 1984,
although he does not give them this name. The trick is likely even
older than that (he points to a paper by Bird), though I have not the
knowledge to confirm this.

The implementation of priority search queues is described in [[http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ralf.hinze/publications/UU-CS-2001-09.pdf]["A Simple
Implementation Technique for Priority Search Queues"]] by Ralf Hinze.

The heaps use a height-biased leftist tree implementation.

Finger trees are described in [[http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html][Finger trees: a simple general-purpose
data structure]] by Ross Paterson and Ralf Hinze.

Hash Array Map Tries are described in the paper [[http://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf][Ideal Hash Trees]] by
Phil Bagwell.

** Thanks
Thanks to [[https://github.com/leppie][Llewellyn Pritchard]] for testing this on [[https://ironscheme.codeplex.com/][IronScheme]], to [[https://github.com/marcomaggi][Marco
Maggi]] for testing on [[https://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare][Vicare Scheme]], and to [[http://wingolog.org/][Andy Wingo]] for pointing out
priority search queues to me, and prodding me into implementing them.
