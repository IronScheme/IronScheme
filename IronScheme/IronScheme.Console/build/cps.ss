;;; This file implements a simple, redex-free, and general
;;; continuation-passing style code generator.  The representation of
;;; the output is isolated from the details of the CPS, and the code
;;; generation routines are provided for use by a driver.  At the
;;; bottom of the file there is a sample output format, as well as a
;;; sample driver written with Alex Shinn's MATCH macro for matching
;;; patterns of S-expressions; the macro's definition is available at
;;; <http://synthcode.com/scheme/match.scm>.
;;;
;;; One ostensibly internal routine bears elaboration:
;;; CPS/GENERATE-SUBPROBLEMS.  This is what orders, or doesn't order,
;;; the resulting program.  The definition supplied here orders
;;; subproblems left-to-right.  CPS/GENERATE-COMBINATION uses whatever
;;; order CPS/GENERATE-SUBPROBLEMS chooses for the *reversed* list of
;;; operator and operands.  If your output format can support order-
;;; independent data structures, here called parallel fork and parallel
;;; join nodes, you should use the alternative definition that does not
;;; commit to a particular order of evaluation of subproblems.  Also,
;;; CPS/GENERATE-SUBPROBLEMS may be useful for generating non-standard
;;; combinations, such as combinations whose operators are known and
;;; can benefit from slight variation in their generation.
;;;
;;; This file is subject to change.  Specifically, it would be nice to
;;; supply auxiliary information to the generators, so that we can, for
;;; instance, annotate the output terms with source history, without
;;; dramatically affecting the structure of the generator.  I have not
;;; yet conceived the best way to go about this.  Don't stay tuned,
;;; however, for it is unlikely that I shall find time to think
;;; seriously about such questions.

;;;; CPS Generation

;;; The procedures CPS/GENERATE-* return code generator procedures that
;;; accept continuators as arguments.  A continuator is a description
;;; of what to do next in the program; see below for details.
