;;;; Syntactic Parameters

;;; These are operations not intrinsic to the concept of syntactic
;;; environments; they are supplied by the client of the syntactic
;;; environment abstraction, primarily to control the format of the
;;; output.

;;; The access path for syntactic parameters is faster than that for
;;; name lookup, because we can elide the hierarchy.  When
;;; constructing a syntactic environment, it usually contains a copy
;;; of the reference to the parent's syntactic parameters, so there is
;;; no iterative indirection, as there is for name lookup.  Deeply
;;; nested binding forms, then, pose no problem for the performance of
;;; these procedures.
