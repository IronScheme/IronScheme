Where can you help?

- Compiler optimization (currently I do no source optimization!)
- Better CLR integration (think auto-generated R6RS libraries)
- A proper Scheme type system (example for numbers/ports)
- Rewriting/refactoring a lot of the C# runtime code back into Scheme 
- A better editor... (I have a sad fasination with them, see xacc.ide) or VisualStudio shell integration like the one for IronPython
- Possible proper call/cc support (not sure if this will ever be worth the effort)
