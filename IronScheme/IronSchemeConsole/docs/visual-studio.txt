Visual Studio
=============

I have developed a little syntax highlighter for Visual Studio 2008 for R6RS Scheme.

Features:

- It has proper Scheme lexing and parsing (it just a copy of what I have in IronScheme itself)
- Syntax highlighting
- Brace matching (with an interesting but somehow useful 'bug')

To do:

- Code completion
- Member info
- REPL
- Quickinfo (tooltip)
- Navigation Bar
- IronScheme Project's

Requirements:

- Visual Studio 2008 Standard or better

Installation:

- Run from the command line: 
  * RegPkg /ranu /codebase <absolute path of IronScheme.VisualStudio.dll>
  * devenv /nosetupvstemplates

- You can exit Visual Studio now. The IronScheme editor will open for .ss, .sls, .sps files.

Uninstallation:

- Run from the comamnd line:
  * RegPkg /unregister <absolute path of IronScheme.VisualStudio.dll>
