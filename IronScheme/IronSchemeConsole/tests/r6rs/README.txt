
------------------------- An R6RS Test Suite -------------------------

======================================================================
Files and libraries
======================================================================

Files that end ".sps" are R6RS programs. The main one is "run.sps",
which runs all the tests.

Files that end ".sls" are R6RS libraries. For example, "base.sls" is a
library that implements `(tests r6rs base)', which is a set of tests
for `(rnrs base)'. Many R6RS implementations will auto-load ".sls"
files if you put the directory of tests in the right place.

In general, for each `(rnrs <id> ... <id>)' in the standard:

 * There's a library of tests "<id>/.../<id>.sls". It defines and
   exports a function `run-<id>-...<id>-tests'.

 * There's a program "run/<id>/.../<id>.sps" that imports
   "<id>/.../<id>.sls", runs the tests, and reports the results.

And then there's 

 * "run.sps", which runs all the tests (as noted above)

 * "run-via-eval.sps", which is similar to "run.ss" but runs each set
    of tests via `eval'

 * "test.sls", containing `(tests r6rs test)', which implements the
   testing utilities that are used by all the other libraries

 * "contrib.sls" and "run/contrib.sps", which implement and run
   contributed tests; these tests might be contributed when someone
   finds a bug in an implementation that seems worth testing in other
   implementations; also, they may be difficult to pin to a particular
   R6RS library; finally, they may use extra libraries from the
   "contrib" sub-directory

======================================================================
Limitations and feedback
======================================================================

The test suite tries to cover all of the bindings of R6RS, and it
tries to check a variety of uses

One goal of this test suite is to avoid using `eval' (except when
specifcally testing `eval'). Avoiding `eval' makes the test suite as
useful as possible to ahead-of-time compilers that implement `eval'
with a separate interpreter. A drawback of the current approach,
however, is that if an R6RS implementation doesn't supply one binding
or does not support a bit of syntax used in a set of tests, then the
whole set of tests fails to load.

A related problem is that each set of tests is placed into one
function that runs all the tests. This format creates a block of code
that is much larger than in a typical program, which might give some
compilers trouble.

In any case, reports of bugs (in the tests) and new tests would be
very much appreciated. File either as a PLT Scheme bug report at

   http://bugs.plt-scheme.org

Hints on running the tests
======================================================================

Ikarus (version 0.0.3+)
------

Put this directory at "<somewhere>/tests/r6rs" and run with "run.sps"

  cd <somewhere>
  ikarus --r6rs-script tests/r6rs/run.sps

or run an individual library's test, such as "run/program.sps" as

  cd <somewhere>
  ikarus --r6rs-script tests/r6rs/run/program.sps

Larceny (version 0.962)
-------

Put this directory at "<somewhere>/tests/r6rs" and run with "run.sps"

  larceny -path <somewhere> -r6rs -program run.sps

or run an individual library's test, such as "run/program.sps" as

  larceny -path <somewhere> -r6rs -program run/program.sps

PLT Scheme (version 4.0.2.5)
----------

If you get an SVN-based or the "Full" nightly build, then these tests are
in a `tests/r6rs' collection already. You can run all of the tests using

   mzscheme -l tests/r6rs/run.sps

and so on.

Otherwise, install this directory as a `tests/r6rs' collection,
perhaps in the location reported by

  (build-path (find-system-path 'addon-dir) 
              (version) "collects"
              "tests" "r6rs")

Four tests fail; they correspond to documented non-conformance with
R6RS.

Ypsilon (version 0.9.6)
-------

Put this directory at "<somewhere>/tests/r6rs" and run with "run.sps":

  cd <somewhere>
  ypsilon --sitelib=. --clean-acc tests/r6rs/run.sps

or run an individual library's test, such as "run/program.sps" as

  cd <somewhere>
  ypsilon --sitelib=. --clean-acc tests/r6rs/run/program.sps
