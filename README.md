IronScheme
==========

Mirror of Codeplex/SVN

Building
========

1. Open the `IronScheme2008.sln` file in VS2008, VS2010, VS2012, VS2013 (or VS 14 CTP)
2. Allow the project to be converted if needed
3. Set startup project as `IronScheme.Console`
4. Set the solution profile to `Release` (optional, but recommended)

Notes
=====

- The CLR 4 debugger is rather slow. Recommended to stick to CLR 2 .NET versions.
